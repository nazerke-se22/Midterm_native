# Personal Task Tracker
### Swift | Console-based Application
## Project Overview

Personal Task Tracker is a simple console-based application developed in Swift.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate core programming concepts covered in the course, including variables, control flow, collections, functions, closures, and object-oriented programming principles.
The application allows users to manage personal tasks by creating, viewing, updating, deleting, sorting, and filtering tasks through a text-based menu.
